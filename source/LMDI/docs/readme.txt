LMDI Suite

The LMDI Suite ("Lazarus MDI" Interface Simulation) is composed of components to make a simulation of MDI application.
It is written entirely based on components already in the VCL/LCL (TPanel, TImage, etc).
The LMDI Suite contains the following components:

TButtonsBar = A bar of buttons to minimize, restore, and close the windows childs (also can be used for other purposes)
TFormPanel = A sort of "windows-childs", which will be used as a skeleton for the component TChildDoc (see MultiDoc)
TTitleBar = A bar of title, descendant of TButtonsBar, which will be used in windows-childs and will drag these windows in the container (TMultiDoc)
