# MyDBFStudio

MyDbf Studio is a multiplatform opensource program made with Lazarus that will help you to manage your dbf tables.
The main features are:

* You can work with multiple tables at once, in mdi forms.
* You can directly add, modify or delete data.
* You can view deleted data.
* You can create, empty, delete, change or restructure a table.
* You can create, delete or modify any index in a table.
* You can add or substract two tables.
* You can directly export data in the following formats: CSV, HTML, XLS, DBF, XML or SQL script.
* It works on Windows, Linux and all platforms supported by Lazarus.

It is distributed as source code. You must compile it with a recent Lazarus version, v2.0 or later.

The program was originally written by <b>Calogiuri Enzo Antonio</b> (aka Fog76), but since its sources are no longer readily available 
I decided to put them onto my github and to reafactor them at a few places.
